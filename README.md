Project Overview

jAudio is an easy-to-use digital signal processor that provides audio feature extraction, including beat points and statistical summaries among many others. These properties can be fed to machine learning toolkits (such as Weka) to automatically extract properties, such as artist or genre, from unknown music. Other interesting applications include predictions around hit songs and personal enjoyment.

The application can be used through a graphical user interface (GUI), command-line interface (CLI) or by embedding. It works best with the extensive in-application help system (requires MultiHelp). The [git archive](https://github.com/dmcennis/jAudioGIT/tree/master/extras/help/en_US) contains relevant documentation.

History

jAudio is the end product of a collaboration between Cory McKay and Daniel McEnnis. The core design is from Daniel McEnnis. The core DSP engine is written by Cory McKay. Version 0.3 (published for the ISMIR 2005 conference) integrated the Daniel McEnnis's class project into Cory McKay's original implementation. This version was extended for 0.4 for the ISMIR 2006 conference. Additional extensions related to OMEN were added in 2006.
